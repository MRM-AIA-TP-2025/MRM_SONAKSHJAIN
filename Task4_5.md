In the 4th task I created a branch Temp. Then I created a .md file and pushed the update to the remote repository. This created a new branch called Temp with the Task_3.md file.
In the 5th task I merged the branch Temp and main, thus updating it in the local repository. Created a new .md file and pushed the updates to the remote repository.
The git commands used were as follows:
1. git checkout -b Temp
2. git add .
3. git commit -m <message>
4. git push -u origin Temp
5. git checkout main
6. git merge Temo
7. git add .
8. git commit -m "final commit"
9. git push -u origin main
